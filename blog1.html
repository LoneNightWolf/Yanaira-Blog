                <p>Google Duplex is an A.I system that was introduced during the Google I/O 2018. 
                One beneficial effect the computing innovation has the potential to have is that 
                it will lessen the workload of a busy person. During Google I/O 2018, Google Duplex 
                was able to make a haircut appointment while having a natural conversation. Google 
                Duplex was able to adapt to a conversion by processing and understanding the 
                conversation it held with the person over the phone. Duplex sounded and thought like 
                a person, which allowed it to book a haircut appointment for its user. The A.I 
                system will lessen the workload of a person because it will be able to make 
                appointments for its user and would allow the person to focus their time on more 
                important things. 
                One harmful effect the computing innovation has the potential to have is that people 
                would become accustomed to having conversations with Google Duplex. People might stop
                communicating with other people due to interacting with Duplex. People wouldn't need 
                to interact with another person, if an A.I system is already doing it for them. Some 
                human communications occurs when a person is having a conversation over the phone. 
                Google Duplex would handle this daily activity by having a conversation with a person 
                and booking an appointment. The A.I system would make people less social because 
                Duplex is handling the conversations over the phone by itself. </p>
                <p>2d:</p>
                    <p>Google Duplex is an Artificial Intelligence that uses the Natural Process 
                    Language. NPL allows Duplex to mimic the human voice and conversation patterns 
                    like “um” and “uh”, which allows it to mimic human conversation. Google Duplex 
                    consumes the conversation it is having with the human over the phone, which is 
                    conversation text. The conversation text comes from the human the A.I is holding 
                    a conversation with. This allows, Duplex to produce responses that mimic human 
                    speech patterns and hold a natural conversation. Duplex is also able to problem 
                    solve in certain occasions. During Google I/O 2018, Google Duplex was able to 
                    problem solve when it had to book a haircut appointment. Duplex was able to decide
                    and agree with a time between 10am and 12pm with the hairdresser, and the person 
                    did not even know that she was having a conversation with an A.I system. The A.I 
                    system transforms data because Duplex has been created to adapt to a person, 
                    instead of a person having to adapt the system to themselves. The data security 
                    concern is that the A.I system can deceive a human into believing that they are 
                    conversing with another person. In the demonstration, the hairdresser believed 
                    she was talking to another human due to Google Duplex having speech patterns and 
                    a voice that is like a human. This is concerning as a person at one point in time
                    could create another A.I system that would deceive people on purpose. </p>
