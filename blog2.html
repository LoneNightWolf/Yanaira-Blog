                <p>Computational Artifact</p>
                
                <p>2a:</p>
                    <p>Netflix is a media company that allows users to access their content online and
                    stream it to various devices.[1] The goal of the stream service was for the content
                    to always be available and affordable.[2] The first four sections of the artifact 
                    show how Netflix gains its content and distributes it to various devices all over 
                    the world by utilizing AWS servers and freely providing Netflix Open Connection to 
                    Internet Service Providers. The last section shows how the Netflix App utilizes Open
                    Connection to provide the user with the best quality video in a short amount of time.

                    <p>The website utilized to create this new artifact was Canva. The design was 
                    Infographic and it was originally a template known as <q>The New Lawyers</q>. The 
                    majority of the images were selected from the internet and the search was Netflix
                    Open Connect, AWS Servers, and people watching Netflix. A few images came from the 
                    article <q>How Netflix works</q> and they were Content Delivery Network and content 
                    providers.[3] Text was added to the infographic to give a short description on the
                    purpose of the images and arrows were added to show the process of when a person 
                    chose a video.</p>
                <p>2c:</p>
                    <p>The benefits and harmful effects that Netflix has created are seen in the 
                    Netflix binge culture and its impact on rental services. Unlike regular 
                    television, Netflix releases <q>full seasons of a show at once</q>.[3] This has led
                    to the creation of the Netflix binge culture because members are able to 
                    instantly watch all the episodes of a series. Netflix is also commercial free 
                    and you are able to download content and watch it offline.[4] The benefit is 
                    that it allows people to have quick and easy access to their favorite tv shows
                    and movies, as they do not have to wait for the following episode, for the 
                    commercials to end, or to get home. However, the Netflix binge culture is 
                    harmful as it has decreased the amount of patience and has led to the feelings
                    of entitlement in the new generation. Netflix’s streaming service allowed people
                    to watch tv shows, movies, and Netflix originals wherever they go and at any time
                    that they desired.[5] The benefit was that people no longer needed to make the 
                    effort to rent a movie or a series that might not be available at their rental 
                    places. The rise of Netflix led to Blockbuster going bankrupt and Redbox losing 
                    customers.[6] The harmful effect was that it caused Blockbuster to lose customers
                    to the point it went bankrupt and it took customers away from Redbox, as people 
                    no longer needed to go to a rental service to find movies and shows.</p>
                <p>2d:</p>
                    <p>Netflix has been able to become successful due to its recommendation system
                    that was created by an algorithm that gathers the customers data. Netflix’s 
                    algorithm gathers ratings, searches, date the movie or show was watched, the 
                    device used, nature of the shows or movies watched on the different devices, 
                    times the program is paused, parts that get re-watched, and if the credits are
                    skipped.[7] This has allowed Netflix to discover and produce movies and shows 
                    that appeal to their customers. It has also changed the way users interact with 
                    Netflix on their devices. The algorithm has led to the profile of every user being
                    unique as it organizes the content available to appeal to what the users like to 
                    watch. Netflix makes personal recommendation based on the user’s data, genres 
                    shown differ from user to user, contains a section on what is trending, and has a 
                    section that allows the user to continue watching shows or movies that they did 
                    not finish.[7] Netflix’s big data on their members activities has led to the 
                    personalization of each members’ profile. 
                    One concern that comes from Netflix is not how people’s information would get 
                    stolen, but how Netflix can utilize the data they gather through their algorithm.
                    Netflix does not have the issue of member’s personal information being stolen, as
                    they do not sell their member’s data to advertisers.[8] The problem isn’t data security,
                    it’s data privacy. Netflix recommendation system allows them to shift and control the way
                    people think.</p>
